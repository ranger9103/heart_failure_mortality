  Heart failure is a leading cause for many deaths in America. The CDC reported that in 2018 close to 400,000 Americans died from some form of heart failure. During a study in 2012, it was determined that 6.2 million Americans had heart failure as a medical condition, leading to a cost of over $30 billion in health care costs (CDC, 2020). 

  Several of the team members work within healthcare, with interest in this field present, we wanted to take a look at a healthcare issue to see what drove the in-hospital mortality of heart failure patients. With heart failure becoming a greater issue for patients everyday, we wanted to take a look into the causes of heart failure. 
 
  Heart failure treatment is a major contributor to in-hospital mortality, and with that come great costs of care. The dataset that we used, had information on patients that either died in care or survived to discharge (Kaggle, 2021). 
 
  With this data we explored heart failure and how certain comorbidities and lab results can predict if a patient will survive while in hospital care to discharge, or if the patient died in care. This was completed by first doing an exploratory analysis to determine what factors correlate with the target variable of survival or in hospital death. This review was carried through visualizations utilizing Tableau and running machine learning methods to make predictions on the features with most correlation to the target variable. All of this is presented on a student built website.
